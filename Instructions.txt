For Linux/Mac:
              Run following to execute the bash scripts:
                chmod +x beat.sh && chmod +x worker.sh

              install the requirements stated in req.txt:
                pip3 install -r req.txt

              install MySQL and create a database named "paper":
                https://dev.mysql.com/doc/
              update database credentials in PaperMetrics/settings.py if needed

              also install redis:
                https://redis.io/download
              After downloading redis, add it to path variable.

              You have to open 4 sperate terminal tabs and run following in each of them:
                1) ./beat.sh
                2) ./worker.sh
                3) python manage.py runserver
                4) redis-server


              The beat script runs the task to email every 5 minutes ( For testing ).
              You can change it to desired time as per your needs from admin panel

              The worker script gets the task and executes and sends the email.
              The redis works as background queue on which tasks are executed.
