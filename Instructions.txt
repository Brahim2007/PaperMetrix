For Linux/Mac:
              Run following to execute the bash scripts:
                chmod +x beat.sh && chmod +x worker.sh

              install the requirements stated in req.txt:
                pip3 install -r req.txt

              install MySQL and create a database named `paper` (or adjust
              environment variables `MYSQL_DATABASE`, `MYSQL_USER`,
              `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_HOST`, and `MYSQL_PORT` as needed).

              also install redis:
                https://redis.io/download
              After downloading redis, add it to path variable.

              You have to open 4 sperate terminal tabs and run following in each of them:
                1) ./beat.sh
                2) ./worker.sh
                3) python manage.py runserver
                4) redis-server


              The beat script runs the task to email every 5 minutes ( For testing ).
              You can change it to desired time as per your needs from admin panel

              The worker script gets the task and executes and sends the email.
              The redis works as background queue on which tasks are executed.

For windows:
              install the requirements stated in req.txt:
                pip install -r req.txt

              install MySQL and create a database named `paper` or configure
              `MYSQL_DATABASE`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_HOST`,
              and `MYSQL_PORT` environment variables as needed.
              
              also install redis:
                https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases/tag/win-3.0.504
              After downloading redis, add it to path variable.

                2) bash -c './worker.sh'
